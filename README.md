## Description:
This is a game based off the popular app for breaking bricks. The goal of the gme is to clear out all of the randomly generated blocks along the board by shooing a single ball around the map. The game ends when you run out of balls (live) or you finish clearing out all the bricks. Your score will be kept based on hw many you complete and a high score will be calculated based on how many brick you broke.

However ifthe player managages to pick up the power up with the brick slider, they will otain the appropriate special effect of the power up.
