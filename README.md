## Description:
This is a game based off the popular app for breaking bricks. The goal of the gme is to clear out all of the randomly generated blocks along the board by shooing a single ball around the map. The game ends when you run out of balls (live) or you finish clearing out all the bricks. Your score will be kept based on hw many you complete and a high score will be calculated based on how many brick you broke.

After the player breaks a bick, there is a random chance for a power up to appear. Once the power up appeas it falls down to the bottom and is deleted once it hits the floor. However ifthe player managages to pick up the power up with the brick slider, they will otain the appropriate special effect of the power up.
