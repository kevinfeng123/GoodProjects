Summary: This is a game based off the popular app for breaking bricks. The goal of the game is to clear out all of the randomly generated blocks along the board by shooting volleys of balls that bounce around the map. The game ends when the blocks shift all the way down to the end of the map. Your score will be kept based on how many bricks you break and high scores will be saved.	

Steps: The player has to choose an angle to shoot the volley in a certain direction to break the blocks. The balls stay within the map, bouncing off blocks and walls until they fall down to the bottom side, at which point they die. Each time a ball hits a block, the health of the block decreases by 1 and when the health reaches 0, the block is cleared. After each volley, a new block level is created from the top and the bricks all shift downward by one. The number of balls within the volley is increased every time you collect randomly generated green power ups (which is done by hitting them with balls).

Features:
- Different shapes of blocks (triangles and rectangles)
- Adjust speed of the ball (fast forward mode, and regular)
- Powerups (double damage, duplicate balls
- Different color schemes for remaining health of block 
- Different level designs 
- Different balls to shoot
